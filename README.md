# Gaussian Splatting for SLAM

This project aims is a dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that aims to leverage Gaussian splatting to achieve photo-realistic reconstructions. For the last-year excellence program at Sapienza University of Rome, the project focuses on creating a robust model for SLAM using Gaussian representations. SLAM is a critical component in robotics and computer vision, enabling robots and autonomous systems to navigate and map their environment. 

The method builds upon the foundation provided by NerfStudio, a powerful library for 3D reconstruction. Specifically, Gaussian-SLAM utilizes NerfStudioâ€™s Splatfacto method as a starting point. On top of that, a tracking module is implemented to to enhance system robustness against camera motion and occlusions. As a result, unlike many SLAM models that rely on depth information, the model can operates solely on RGB images. Lastly, to maintain a diverse set of images, a covisibility control mechanism aims to select a subset of diverse images to balance the need for coverage with minimizing redundancy.

On the left, the image displays an overview of the SLAM system, with the highlighted implemented components. On the right, you can see the output scene representation of my custom dataset (my room) after 20 minutes of training on a 1-minute RGB video.

## Getting Started.


1. **Install NerfStudio**:
   - Follow the guidelines provided [here](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/installation.html).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this [repository](https://github.com/alessandro-potenza/Gaussian_Splatting_SLAM) to your local system.

3. **Install this Repository as a Python Package**:
   - Change your directory to the cloned repository folder.
   - Initiate the installation of the package in editable mode by executing the command:
     ```
     python -m pip install -e .
     ```
   - Run `ns-install-cli` to establish the required command-line interface.
   - Verify the successful installation by executing:
     ```
     ns-train -h
     ```
     The `gaussian_splatting_slam` method should appear in the list of subcommands.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - Launch training using the command:
     ```
     ns-train gaussian_splatting_slam --data <data_folder>
     ```
     Replace `<data_folder>` with the path to your data folder.
   - You can use either [existing datasets](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/existing_dataset.html) or [create your custom dataset](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/custom_dataset.html).
